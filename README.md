This code allows you to work efficiently by following the Pomodoro method.
The timer has 25 minutes of work and then a short 5 minute break. 
After 4 repetition of 25 minutes of work and 5 min break, there will be a long 20 minute break.
Clicking start starts the program and will keep running until you are done your task. 
Clicking reset will start the timer from the beginning again. 
I hope you can use it to work more efficiently!
